# What is the AWS SDK for \.NET<a name="welcome"></a>

The AWS SDK for \.NET makes it easier to build \.NET applications that tap into cost\-effective, scalable, and reliable AWS services such as Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\)\. The SDK simplifies the use of AWS services by providing a set of libraries that are consistent and familiar for \.NET developers\.\.
