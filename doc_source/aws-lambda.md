# Using AWS Lambda for compute service<a name="aws-lambda"></a>

The AWS SDK for \.NET supports AWS Lambda, which lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers\. For more information, see the [AWS Lambda product page](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and the [AWS Lambda Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/), particularly the section for [Working with C\#](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-csharp.html)\.

## APIs<a name="w2aac21c17b5"></a>

The AWS SDK for \.NET provides APIs for AWS Lambda\. The APIs enable you to work with Lambda features such as [functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-concepts.html#gettingstarted-concepts-function), [triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-concepts.html#gettingstarted-concepts-trigger), and [events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-concepts.html#gettingstarted-concepts-event)\. To view the full set of APIs, see [Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkfornet/v3/apidocs/items/Lambda/NLambda.html) in the [AWS SDK for \.NET API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkfornet/v3/apidocs/)\.

The Lambda APIs are provided by [NuGet packages](https://www.nuget.org/packages?page=2&q=aws%20lambda&sortBy=relevance)\.
