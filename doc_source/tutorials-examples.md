If you're new to the AWS SDK for \.NET, you might want to check out the [Quick start](quick-start.md) topic first\. It gives you an introduction to the SDK\.

You can find more code examples in the [AWS Code Examples Repository](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/dotnetv3) and the [awslabs repository](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-net-samples) on GitHub\.

Before you begin, be sure you have [set up your environment](net-dg-setup.md)\. Also review the information in [Setting up your project](net-dg-config.md) and [SDK features](net-dg-sdk-features.md)\.
